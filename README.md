# glance - simplified work space

## Description - why

---

I love use all sorts of management tools, simply because I am kinda obsessed with the beauty of each tool has its core idea of how to solve problems.

For me, I have encountered a problem of organizing files, the company I worked for was using google products, so when I was a new joiner, I hardly found the "right" docs, not to mention majority of docs were outdated, so I was thinking what if we can have a light weight tool to help people manage work space?

Since I am still a novice of web development,but knowing that I can actually build something, that feels good :)

This project is inspired by #Netninja, thank you for creating such great course, I've learnt a lot from you.
